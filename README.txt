Il-2 Cliffs of Dover
Mission progress script

Basic script so save the campaign mission progress
The results for each mission is displayed on the mission briefing

How to use the files:

- Open a campaign
- Add the MissionProgress.cs script to it
- Modify each mission "cs" file with the content of the "Mission-name.cs" file


Limitation: The script is "almost" generic, it needs minor modifications to be
used with the RAF campaigns.
